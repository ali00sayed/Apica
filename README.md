# Apica
React features a, responsive table with state management. It conditionally renders an image or icon based on navigation state. The app includes search, date selection, and status filtering, with conditional styling applied to statuses (pending, paid, rejected). It uses Tailwind CSS for responsive design and includes basic pagination.
